Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to construct a website that allows people to filter and search through data in order to find information on UFO sightings. Specifically, the user is supposed to be able to use multiple data points to search a ufo sighting that most closely fits what the user is searching for.

Results

To perform a search on this site, the goal was to have the user work from their most general data point and work in. So if you know for sure, for instance, that your specific UFO sighting took place in California, put ca in the state search and narrow that down first. Then, say that reminds you of the shape of that UFO, you can type that in and narrow it down from there. To start a new search, you can refresh the page and start aginf rom your most general data point.

Summary

This web page is limited in its application, and one drawback is you can't do multiple searches without refreshing the page. A couple recommendations in addition to being able to do multiple searches without refreshing the page would be to allow it to filter input that matches multiple points of data; for instance, if you type ca in the state and 1/10/2010 in the date, it should pull up matches that have ca for the state AND/OR data that has 1/10/2010 for the date. This allows for wider searches if the user is unsure of their best point of data. Also, you could allow a user to submit their own UFO viewing experience to be added to the data set if so allowed.
